# 1. Search for *every* line in the current directory (recursively) with rg
#    -H          Always show file names
#    --no-heading  Never print file headings
#    -n          Show line numbers
#    ''          Empty pattern, matches every line
#    .           Current directory
#
# 2. Pipe the results to fzf for interactive selection.
#    If the user cancels the selection, fzf exits non-zero, so we can just exit.
selected="$(rg -H --no-heading -n '' . | fzf --no-mouse --height=22)" || exit 0

# If nothing was selected (i.e., user pressed ESC in fzf), also exit.
[ -z "$selected" ] && exit 0

# The output from rg is in the form:  FILENAME:LINE:TEXT
# We can extract FILENAME and LINE using sd (regex-based find/replace).
file="$(echo "$selected" | sd '^([^:]+):(\d+):.*' '$1')"
line="$(echo "$selected" | sd '^([^:]+):(\d+):.*' '$2')"

# Finally, open the file at the selected line in vi.
